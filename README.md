Code to calculate Excess Heat Factor

This code calculates the Excess Heat Factor (EHF) for a data frame. The EHF is an index created by John Nairn and Robert Fawcett in 2015 (doi:10.3390/ijerph120100227). It is used to define and classify heat waves and is great for any analisys related to the impact on human health. 
This code was written as a part of a research project from LAGAS laboratoty in the University of Brasilia in Brazil
I wrote and ran the code on google colab across multiple code cells, but it should work on any IDE of your choice
